              <h5> You need to make sure that people trust you </h5>
              My sister use to tell me that people need to know you, trust you and like you if you want to achieve something. Well, it also applies here, with a special emphasis on trust. Usually your               supervisor or team leader could see you around in an office and get some sense of what keeps you busy. However, in remote work it does not exist in that form, so you need to make sure                  that your work has been documented, but that is another point to talk about.
              
              </p><p><h5> You need to write almost EVERYTHING down. </h5>
              I believe it is among the most specific characteristics of a remote work - documenting. Documenting refers to having a written trace of your work, preferably of everything you work on.                 You usually happen to have less verbal conversations with your colleagues than you usually do in office, so you need to create a habit of documenting things.
              
              </p><p><h5> You very often can't make a difference between work and life</h5>
              You probably expected this. So won't bother much with this.
              
              </p><p><h5> Discipline on incredible level </h5>
              This is a tricky one. In a conversation with a colleague who works "offline", he/she could notice how you are lucky that you work from your home and don't need to go outside of your home.               Yeah, that is true, but…it takes discipline to make a difference.
              
              </p><p><h5> Next-level organisation </h5>
              Get used to doing different things from what majority around you is doing. When everyone is going home, you might feel strange, because you are kind of home, but not.
              
              </p><p><h5> Doing what others don't. </h5>
              
              </p><p><h5> Simulate "normal life"</h5>
              Every morning try to go out, as if you do go to your office. It helps me to work more efficiently.
              
              </p><p><h5> Morning person </h5>
              From 8–13 you can finish the most of your job.
              
              </p><p><h5>Effective written communication</h5>
